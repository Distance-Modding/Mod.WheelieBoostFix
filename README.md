# Distance Wheelie Boost Fix
This [Centrifuge](https://github.com/Ciastex/Centrifuge) mod is an attempt at nerfing Wheelie Boosting so that it's no longer a viable strategy.

Wheelie Boosting [is defined](https://tntmatthew.github.io/distance/terms.html) as "Jumping, tilting up, and using grip repeatedly to increase speed. Basically the Distance equivalent of bunny hopping."

This plugin disables getting times on leaderboards while enabled. See the mods's `Settings.json` for configuration.
